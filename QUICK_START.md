## ⚡ Get Running in 5 Minutes

### 1. **Set Your API Key**
```bash
# Option A: Environment variable (recommended)
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"

# Option B: Create .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env

# Option C: Edit config.py
# Replace "your_openai_api_key_here" with your actual key
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv numpy
```

### 3. **Test the System**
```bash
# Run the demo to see it in action
python demo_novel_reasoning.py

# Test with ARC challenges
python arc_test_runner.py

# Use the interactive CLI
python src/arcft/scripts/novel_reasoning_cli.py
```

🧠 NOVEL REASONING ENGINE DEMO
==================================================

🚀 Initializing Novel Reasoning Engine...

📝 Problem: I have a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ?

🤔 Solving with novel reasoning engine...
   (This will use meta-cognition, philosophical character compartmentalization,
    hypothesis generation, and dual-answer generation)

✅ SOLUTION GENERATED!
==================================================

🧠 REASONING PROCESS:
   Meta-cognitive reflection: Analyzing mathematical patterns...
   Hypotheses generated: 3

   Hypothesis 1: Geometric progression with ratio 2
   Hypothesis 2: Powers of 2 sequence
   Hypothesis 3: Doubling pattern

💡 ANSWERS GENERATED: 2

   Answer 1 (Confidence: 95.0%):
   64
   Reasoning: This is a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2...

   Answer 2 (Confidence: 90.0%):
   64
   Reasoning: The sequence follows the pattern 2^n where n starts at 1...
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues:**
- **API Key Error**: Make sure you've set your OpenAI API key
- **Import Error**: Ensure you're in the project root directory
- **Rate Limiting**: The system includes built-in delays

### **Need Help?**
- Check `NOVEL_REASONING_README.md` for detailed documentation
- Review `ARC_TESTING_README.md` for ARC-specific guidance
