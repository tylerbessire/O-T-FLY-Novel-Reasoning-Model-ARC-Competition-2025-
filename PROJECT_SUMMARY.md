```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tylerbessire/O-T-FLY-Novel-Reasoning-Model-ARC-Competition-2025-.git
cd O-T-FLY-Novel-Reasoning-Model-ARC-Competition-2025-

# Install dependencies
pip install openai python-dotenv numpy

# Set your OpenAI API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
```

### 2. **Test the System**
```bash
# Run the demo
python demo_novel_reasoning.py

# Test with ARC challenges
python arc_test_runner.py

# Use the CLI interface
python src/arcft/scripts/novel_reasoning_cli.py
```

### 3. **Customize Configuration**
Edit `config.py` to modify:
- Model selection (GPT-5, GPT-4)
- API settings
- Character configurations
- Reasoning parameters

## 🎯 Key Innovations

### 1. **Philosophical Character Compartmentalization**
Each character brings a unique perspective:
- **Socrates**: "What is the fundamental pattern here?"
- **Aristotle**: "How can I categorize these elements systematically?"
- **Descartes**: "What mathematical principles underlie this transformation?"
- **Kant**: "What universal rules govern this pattern?"
- **Nietzsche**: "What creative interpretations are possible?"

### 2. **Meta-Cognitive Reasoning**
The system:
- Reflects on its own thinking process
- Evaluates confidence in its answers
- Adapts strategies based on problem complexity
- Learns from previous reasoning attempts

### 3. **Advanced Pattern Recognition**
Capabilities include:
- Visual-spatial reasoning
- Mathematical pattern identification
- Abstract rule abstraction
- Multi-step problem solving
- Transfer learning between domains
