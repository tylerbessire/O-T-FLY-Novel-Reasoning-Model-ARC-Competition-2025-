Merger & Entry
Description
Note: This is the second ARC Prize competition on Kaggle. It builds upon the ARC Prize 2024. This second competition has an updated dataset of human-calibrated problems and increased compute for participants.

Current AI systems cannot generalize to new problems outside their training data, despite extensive training on large datasets. LLMs have brought AI to the mainstream for a large selection of known tasks. However, progress towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is idea constrained. Improvements in AGI could enable AI systems that think and invent alongside humans.

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI-2) benchmark measures an AI system's ability to efficiently learn new skills. Humans have collectively scored 100% in ARC, whereas the best AI systems only score 4%. The ARC Prize competition encourages researchers to explore ideas beyond LLMs, which depend heavily on large datasets and struggle with novel problems.

This competition includes several components. The competition as described here carries a prize of $125,000 with an additional $600,000 available if any team can beat a score of 85% on the leaderboard. Further opportunities outside of Kaggle may also be available- to learn more visit ARCprize.org.

Your work could contribute to new AI problem-solving applicable across industries. Vastly improved AGI will likely reshape human-machine interactions. Winning solutions will be open-sourced to promote transparency and collaboration in the field of AGI.

Evaluation
This competition evaluates submissions on the percentage of correct predictions. For each task, you should make 2 attempts to predict the exact outputs for every test input grid contained in the task. (Tasks can have more than one test input that needs a predicted output.) Each task test output has one ground truth. For a given task output, any of the 2 predicted outputs matches the ground truth exactly, you score 1 for that task test output, otherwise 0. The final score is the sum averaged of the highest score per task output divided by the total number of task test outputs.

Submission File
The submission file for this competition must be a json named submission.json.

For each task output in the evaluation set, you should make exactly 2 predictions (attempt_1, attempt_2). The structure of predictions is shown below. Many tasks have multiple outputs (a multiple dictionaries enclosed in a list), although some tasks have a single output that must be predicted. When a task has multiple test outputs that need to be predicted (e.g., task 12997ef3 below), they must be in the same order as the corresponding test inputs.

IMPORTANT: All the task_ids in the input challenges json file must also be present in the submission.json file. Both "attempt_1" and "attempt_2" must be present, even if your submission doesn't have 2 predictions.

{"00576224": [{"attempt_1": [[0, 0], [0, 0]], "attempt_2": [[0, 0], [0, 0]]}],
 "009d5c81": [{"attempt_1": [[0, 0], [0, 0]], "attempt_2": [[0, 0], [0, 0]]}],
 "12997ef3": [{"attempt_1": [[0, 0], [0, 0]], "attempt_2": [[0, 0], [0, 0]]},
              {"attempt_1": [[0, 0], [0, 0]], "attempt_2": [[0, 0], [0, 0]]}],

Submission runtimes have been obfuscated. If you repeat the exact same submission you will see up to 10 minutes of variance in the time before you receive your score.

Please see the Code Competition FAQ for more information on how to submit.

Paper Award
You may choose to submit a paper to be eligible to win a Paper Award Prize.

To be eligible for a Paper Award, you must separately submit a paper (Kaggle Notebook, PDF, arXiv, txt, etc.) documenting and describing the conceptual approach of your eligible ARC Prize 2025 Kaggle submission. Paper submissions must be submitted within 6 days of the competition ending and must be public (thus, also open-sourced).

Paper Awards are evaluated equally on the following six components, where a score of 0 (lowest) and 5 (highest) is given in each category.

Category   	Description	 
Accuracy	How accurate is the submission based on its performance on the leaderboard? (Note: you will be asked to provide your submission ID to match your notebook to your submission)  	 
Universality 	How general and universal is the Submission approach beyond the competition? Does your submission translate to other similar problems? How well does your method generalize?	
Progress	How much does the paper increase the overall chance of anyone achieving 85% on ARC Prize?	
Theory	How well does the paper describe why the Submission works (as opposed to merely describing how it works)?	
Completeness	How thoroughly and completely does the paper cover your submission to the leaderboard?	
Novelty	How novel is the Submission relative to existing public research?	
The Paper Award will be awarded to the Submission with the most points and the Paper Award Runner Up will the second most points. Your Paper rubric evaluation will not be shared with you. In the event of a tie, the Paper that was entered first to the Competition will be the winner. In the event a potential winner is disqualified for any reason, the Paper that received the next highest score rank will be chosen as the potential winner.

Upgraded Accelerators
This competition has access to Kaggle's pool of powerful new L4x4 machines! These machines offer 96GB of GPU memory enabling submissions with much larger models. See this page for more on these machines.

What you need to know:

Quota usage - Due to their limited availability, notebooks with L4x4s consume GPU quota at twice the rate of the older T4x2 and P100 machines. We may increase this rate as necessary to ensure these machines are available for submission scoring.
Restricted Use - L4s are only available for notebooks attached to this competition. We will build tooling to enforce this if necessary. In the meantime, attempts to circumvent this restriction may be enforced by Kaggle moderation with consequences including team bans from the competition or account bans.
No Internet - All L4 sessions must have internet disabled.

1. TEAM LIMITS
a. The maximum Team size is five (5).
b. Team mergers are allowed and can be performed by the Team leader. In order to merge, the combined Team must have a total Submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowed as of the Team Merger Deadline. The maximum allowed is the number of Submissions per day multiplied by the number of days the competition has been running.

2. SUBMISSION LIMITS
a. You may submit a maximum of one (1) Submission per day.
b. You may select up to two (2) Final Submissions for judging.

3. COMPETITION TIMELINE
a. Competition Timeline dates (including Entry Deadline, Final Submission Deadline, Start Date, and Team Merger Deadline, as applicable) are reflected on the competition’s Overview > Timeline page.

4. COMPETITION DATA
a. Data Access and Use.

You may access and use the Competition Data for any purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial, including for participating in the Competition and on Kaggle.com forums, and for academic research and education. The Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant who uses the Competition Data other than as permitted by the Competition Website and these Rules.
b. Data Security.

You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.
5. WINNER LICENSE
a. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:

Open Source: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see www.opensource.org) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code.

For generally commercially available software that you used to generate your Submission that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, you do not need to grant the license in the preceding Section for that software.

In the event that input data or pretrained models with an incompatible license are used to generate your winning solution, you do not need to grant an open source license in the preceding Section for that data and/or model(s).

b. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor’s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner’s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.

6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS
a. You may use data other than the Competition Data (“External Data”) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations).

b. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., “geo restrictions”) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be “reasonably accessible to all” and of “minimal cost”. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):

Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the "excessive" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a “Reasonableness” standard (the “Reasonableness Standard”). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.

By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.

c. Automated Machine Learning Tools (“AMLT”)

Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (“AMLT”) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules.
7. ELIGIBILITY
a. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. "Competition Entities" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.

8. WINNER’S OBLIGATIONS
a. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:

Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow these documentation guidelines, must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment.
a. To the extent that the final model’s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).”

b. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner’s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,

Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;

Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).

9. GOVERNING LAW
a. Unless otherwise provided in the Competition Specific Rules above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Rules will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the Federal or State courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts.

DATA
Dataset Description
The objective of this competition is to create an algorithm that is capable of solving abstract reasoning tasks. Critically, these are novel tasks: tasks that the algorithm has never seen before. Hence, simply memorizing a set of reasoning templates will not suffice.

The format is different from the previous competition, so please read this information carefully, and refer to supplementary documentation as needed.

When looking at a task, a "test-taker" has access to inputs and outputs of the demonstration pairs (train pairs), plus the input(s) of the test pair(s). The goal is to construct the output grid(s) corresponding to the test input grid(s), using 2 trials for each test input. "Constructing the output grid" involves picking the height and width of the output grid, then filling each cell in the grid with a symbol (integer between 0 and 9, which are visualized as colors). Only exact solutions (all cells match the expected answer) can be said to be correct.

Any additional information, as well as an interactive app to explore the objective of this competition is found at the ARCPrize.org. It is highly recommended that you explore the interactive app, as the best way to understand the objective of the competition.

Task files
The information is stored in two files:

arc-agi_training-challenges.json: contains input/output pairs that demonstrate reasoning pattern to be applied to the "test" input for each task. This file and the corresponding solutions file can be used as training for your models.
arc-agi_training-solutions.json: contains the corresponding task "test" outputs (ground truth).
arc-agi_evaluation-challenges.json: contains input/output pairs that demonstrate reasoning pattern to be applied to the "test" input for each task. This file and the corresponding solutions file can be used as validation data for your models.
arc-agi_evaluation-solutions.json: contains the corresponding task "test" outputs (ground truth).
arc-agi_test-challenges.json: this file contains the tasks that will be used for the leaderboard evaluation, and contains "train" input/output pairs as well as the "test" input for each task. Your task is to predict the "test" output. Note: The file shown on this page is a placeholder using tasks from arc-agi_evaluation-challenges.json. When you submit your notebook to be rerun, this file is swapped with the actual test challenges.
sample_submission.json: a submission file in the correct format
Each task contains a dictionary with two fields:

"train": demonstration input/output pairs. It is a list of "pairs" (typically 3 pairs).
"test": test input - your model should predict the output.
A "pair" is a dictionary with two fields:

"input": the input "grid" for the pair.
"output": the output "grid" for the pair.
A "grid" is a rectangular matrix (list of lists) of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). The smallest possible grid size is 1x1 and the largest is 30x30.

The data on this page should be used to develop and evaluate your models. When notebooks are submitted for rerun, they are scored using 240 unseen tasks found in the rerun file named arc-agi_test_challenges.json. The rerun tasks will contain train pairs of inputs and outputs as well as the tasks test input. Your algorithm must predict the test output. The majority of the 240 tasks used for leaderboard score only have one test input that will require a corresponding output prediction, although for a small number of tasks, you will be asked to make predictions for two test inputs.
