# 🧠 ARC Testing with Novel Reasoning Engine

This document explains how to test our **Novel Reasoning Engine** against the **Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC)** challenges to evaluate its pattern recognition and reasoning capabilities.

## 🎯 What is ARC?

The **Abstract Reasoning Corpus (ARC)** is a collection of pattern recognition tasks that test an AI system's ability to:
- Identify complex patterns from training examples
- Apply abstract reasoning to solve novel problems
- Generalize from limited training data
- Handle visual-spatial reasoning tasks

## 🚀 What We've Built

### 1. **Novel Reasoning Engine** (`src/arcft/novel_reasoning.py`)
- **Meta-cognition**: Self-reflection and awareness in reasoning
- **Philosophical Character Compartmentalization**: Different thinking modes
- **Hypothesis Generation**: Multiple hypotheses before answering
- **Rule Abstraction**: Learning and applying new patterns
- **Dual-Answer Generation**: Two different solutions for better accuracy

### 2. **ARC Test Runner** (`arc_test_runner.py`)
- Automatically loads ARC test challenges
- Uses the novel reasoning engine to solve each task
- Tracks performance metrics and timing
- Generates comprehensive reports

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Required Dependencies
```bash
pip install openai python-dotenv numpy
```

### OpenAI API Key
1. Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Set it in one of these ways:

**Option A: Environment Variable**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
```

**Option B: .env File**
```bash
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here" > .env
```

**Option C: Config File**
Edit `config.py` and replace `"your_openai_api_key_here"` with your actual key.

## 🧪 Running ARC Tests

### Quick Start
```bash
python arc_test_runner.py
```

### What Happens During Testing

1. **Data Loading**: Loads ARC test challenges from `arc-agi_test_challenges.json`
2. **Task Processing**: For each task:
   - Analyzes training examples
   - Generates comprehensive prompts
   - Uses novel reasoning engine to solve
   - Parses and validates responses
3. **Performance Tracking**: Records timing, success rates, and quality metrics
4. **Results Generation**: Creates detailed reports and saves to JSON

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**API Key Errors**
```
❌ Error: OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable not set
```
**Solution**: Set your API key using one of the methods above.

**Import Errors**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'arcft'
```
**Solution**: Ensure you're running from the project root directory.

**Rate Limiting**
```
Rate limit exceeded
```
**Solution**: The script includes delays between requests. For heavy usage, increase delays.

**Memory Issues**
```
MemoryError: Unable to allocate array
```
**Solution**: Reduce `max_tasks` parameter for testing.

### Performance Optimization

1. **Batch Testing**: Test multiple tasks in sequence
2. **Model Selection**: Use appropriate model for your needs
3. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling prevents crashes
4. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time monitoring of test progress

## 🔬 Advanced Usage

### Custom Test Scenarios
```python
# Test specific tasks
selected_tasks = {k: v for k, v in test_data.items() if k.startswith('00')}
results = await runner.run_tests(selected_tasks)

# Custom prompt engineering
custom_prompt = runner.create_arc_prompt(task_id, train_examples, test_input)
# Modify prompt as needed
```

### Integration with Other Systems
```python
# Use as a module
from arc_test_runner import ARCTestRunner

runner = ARCTestRunner(api_key)
results = await runner.solve_single_task(task_id, task_data)
```

### Performance Analysis
```python
# Analyze timing patterns
solve_times = [r['solve_time'] for r in results if r['status'] == 'completed']
print(f"Fastest: {min(solve_times):.2f}s")
print(f"Slowest: {max(solve_times):.2f}s")
print(f"Standard deviation: {np.std(solve_times):.2f}s")
